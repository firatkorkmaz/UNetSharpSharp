# U-Net\#\#: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation
Official PyTorch implementation of the MICAD 2022 conference paper: ["U-Net##: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-6775-6_19)

## Information

In this paper, we propose a powerful novel architecture named U-Net##, which consists of multiple overlapping U-Net pathways and has the strategies of sharing feature maps between parallel neural networks, using auxiliary convolutional blocks for additional feature extractions and deep supervision, so that it performs as a boosted U-Net model for medical image segmentation.

## UPDATE: New U-Net\#\# Architecture ##

### Changes: ###
* 3D model version is added.
* Number of filters is reduced by 50%.
* Feature map additions are directed upward.
* BatchNorm layers are replaced with InstanceNorm.
* Weighted summation is implemented for deep supervision.
* Skip connections on the ceiling network pathway are omitted.
* Feature map additions from distant network pathways are omitted.
* Deep supervision outputs are obtained from the ceiling network pathway.
* Final Sigmoid functions are commented out and passed to the loss functions.

### Results: ###
* Better performance.
* ~4x faster training speed.
* Reduced parameters from 43M to 8.85M
* Parameter number of the 3D model is 26.5M

## Results from the Original Architecture

The U-Net## model is evaluated on the TCIA-LGG Segmentation Dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to segment the brain regions with FLAIR abnormalities on the related brain MRI images.

## How to Use

```
# Import available loss functions if needed
from loss.loss import DiceLoss, BCEDiceLoss

# Import model architectures
from model.UNetSharpSharp2D import UNetSharpSharp2D  # 2D model variant
from model.UNetSharpSharp3D import UNetSharpSharp3D  # 3D model variant

# Instantiate the 2D model
model_2d = UNetSharpSharp2D(in_ch=3, out_ch=1, deep_supervision=True)

# Instantiate the 3D model
model_3d = UNetSharpSharp3D(in_ch=3, out_ch=1, deep_supervision=True)
```
