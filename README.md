In this paper, we propose a powerful novel architecture named U-Net##, which consists of multiple overlapping U-Net pathways and has the strategies of sharing feature maps between parallel neural networks, using auxiliary convolutional blocks for additional feature extractions and deep supervision, so that it performs as a boosted U-Net model for medical image segmentation.
