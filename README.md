# U-Net\#\#: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation
Official PyTorch implementation of the MICAD 2022 conference paper: ["U-Net##: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-6775-6_19)

## Information

In this paper, we propose a powerful novel architecture named U-Net##, which consists of multiple overlapping U-Net pathways and has the strategies of sharing feature maps between parallel neural networks, using auxiliary convolutional blocks for additional feature extractions and deep supervision, so that it performs as a boosted U-Net model for medical image segmentation.

## UPDATE: New U-Net\#\# Architecture ##

### Changes: ###
* Feature map additions from distant network pathways are omitted.
* BatchNorm layers are changed to InstanceNorm layers.
* Number of filters is reduced by 50%.

### Results: ###
* Better performance.
* ~4x faster training speed.
* Less number of total parameters: 8.9M

## Results from the Original Architecture

The U-Net## model is evaluated on the TCIA-LGG Segmentation Dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to segment the brain regions with FLAIR abnormalities on the related brain MRI images.
