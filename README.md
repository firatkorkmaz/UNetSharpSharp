# U-Net##: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation
Official PyTorch implementation of the MICAD 2022 conference paper: ["U-Net##: A Powerful Novel Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-6775-6_19)

## Information

In this paper, we propose a powerful novel architecture named U-Net##, which consists of multiple overlapping U-Net pathways and has the strategies of sharing feature maps between parallel neural networks, using auxiliary convolutional blocks for additional feature extractions and deep supervision, so that it performs as a boosted U-Net model for medical image segmentation.

## Results

The U-Net## model is evaluated on the TCIA-LGG Segmentation Dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) to segment the brain regions with FLAIR abnormalities on the related brain MRI images.
